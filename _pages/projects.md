Hi! These are some projects I've worked on over the last few years.

Projects
======
* <strong>[instant-chess](https://instant-chess.vercel.app/)</strong>
    * Chess-playing website made with TypeScript React + [InstantDB’s](https://www.instantdb.com/) React hooks.
* <strong>[VLocNet](https://github.com/srinathvrao/VLocNet)</strong>
    * Pipeline to calculate the location and orientation of a camera relative to its environment from associated camera images.
* <strong>PharmAssist</strong>
    * Android app to keep track of medicine dosages with prescriptions.

Education
======
* <strong>M. S. in Computer Science</strong>, 2021-23 
    * Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ; GPA: 4.0
* <strong>B. Tech. in Information Technology</strong>, 2017-21
    * Anna University, Chennai, India; GPA: 8.63/10

Work experience
======
* <strong>Systems Software Engineer</strong>
    * <strong>ServiceNow, Kirkland, WA</strong> July 2023 - Present
    * Utilized REST APIs in Python to introduce automation for Virtual Machine and bare-metal deployment validation in ServiceNow’s infrastructure. Reduced time taken for deployment validation from 10 days (average time for the manual process) to 3 days on average.
    * Built a minimal in-memory OS Image (60MB in size) for clients to automate hard-disk erasure in ServiceNow’s production environments. Modified Puppet manifests and developed CI/CD pipelines using shell scripts and Python for image deployment. Eliminated the need for a RedHat-8 image, and the requirement to shred used disks, saving the company upwards of $2M/year.
* <strong>Software Engineer Intern</strong>
    * <strong>ServiceNow, San Diego, CA</strong> May 2022 - Aug 2022
    * Implemented Hierarchical Attention Networks in a Natural Language processing pipeline to analyze vulnerability summaries from scanning software, reducing vulnerability owner identification time by 83% of existing process (1 week to 1 day).
    * Developed an OS Image based on the RHEL7 kernel, to execute a disk wipe during the boot sequence. Opened 5 code review requests, and participated in stand-up meetings to ensure adherence to quality.
* <strong>Machine Learning Intern</strong>
    * <strong>AstraZeneca, Chennai, India</strong> May 2020 - July 2020
    * Applied ML algorithms (Random Forest Regressors, Support Vector Regressors, Graph Convolutions) to drug-discovery problems such as estimating digestibility of drugs in human intestine. Compared Chem-Informatics algorithms for feature extraction from molecular structure representations. 
    * Developed an ensemble ML algorithm with Random Forest and Support Vector Regressors which reduced feature extraction time from 15 seconds to 2 seconds per compound, and improved performance (RMSE) by 15%.
* <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>
    * <strong>SSN Model United Nations 2019, Chennai, India</strong> July 2019 - October 2019
    * Led a team of 3 developers in building the website for the college’s Model UN, hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet.
