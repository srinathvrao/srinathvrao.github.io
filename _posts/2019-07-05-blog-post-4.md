AngelHack Virtual Hackathon - Global Runner-Up in AWS Challenge!
------
My friends and I built a novel Android application that assists users in keeping track of medicines and their prescribed dosages, using unique labels. 

I helped in integrating a video chat application for detecting human pulse and heart-rate from video feed, and present that information to doctors contacting patients.

There was a paper presented at CVPR 2013, that interested us, which did the exact same thing!

We used a Java implementation of the same, using Fast Fourier Transforms and simple Image Processing to get the Systolic and Diastolic Pressure from a video feed of a person's face!

I also helped in implementing functions on an Amazon Echo dot. All you would have to do is simply say, "Alexa, open PharmAssist," and ask "How many pills do I need to take today?"

Here's a prototype of the project we demo-ed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNliTSBcyQs


What's the aim of this application?
------
We all know how difficult it is to remember which medicines we have to take, at which intervals. This problem poses a challenge, mainly for senior citizens. This app was built mainly to alleviate this issue. 

We also enabled Text-To-Speech and Speech-To-Text systems in our Android Application to make the user experience hassle-free for older users!

What this ended up becoming
------
This emerged the winner in the Indian Subcontinent in AngelHack's Virtual Hackathon, and we were also invited to AngelHack's Start-Up accelerator program!

It also emerged the Global Runner-Up in an AWS Challenge in the same hackathon! My friends and I won a ton of AWS goodies!
