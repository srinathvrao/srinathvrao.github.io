New thumbnail for my blog posts!?

![Rasengan](/images/Narutooo.jpg)

My friend was kind enough to draw a chibi version of Me and Naruto!

Here, you can see me focusing on a "Rasengan", and Naruto helping me through it.

Check out my friend's [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/the_tanwey_way/) for some more cool art! 

Thank You, @the_tanwey_way! :D
