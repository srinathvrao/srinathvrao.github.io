Hi there!

I hope you're doing fine. Please do wear a mask and take precautions until we get through this Pandemic- and take care of yourself and your loved ones!

I'm Srinath, an Information Technology undergrad student from SSN College of Engineering (Anna University, 2017-2021).

I was a Data Science Intern at [AstraZeneca](https://www.linkedin.com/company/astrazeneca/). I worked closely with a business team to enhance the performance of an existing pipeline to calculate the intrinsic permeability of chemical compounds across the human intestine. I was also a Computer Vision Research intern, and I co-wrote a paper that got accepted to [IEEE CICT 2020](http://www.cict2020.iiitdm.ac.in/). 

I build some fun stuff that I occasionally put [here](https://srinathvrao.github.io/year-archive/).

I've recently started working on applications involving Quaternion Rotations, and Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping ("SLAM") algorithms. I hope to work on Lunar and/or Martian Vehicles that use SLAM algorithms sometime in the future! I'd love to use my knowledge of Computer Vision for this.
