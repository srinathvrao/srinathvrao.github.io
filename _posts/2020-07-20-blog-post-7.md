My First Company Internship!
------

I can't believe I was up and about, interacting with other hackathon participants earlier this year. Man, COVID really sucks. 

I had to do a work-from-home internship. Even then, I learnt so many new concepts! I'm really grateful to my mentor and my manager at AstraZeneca for guiding me throughout the virtual internship.

The entire experience was smooth! Hats off to the AZ tech team, for making the onboarding process smooth.

What I worked on
------
I worked on problems in Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics. For the problem in Cheminformatics, I implemented Graph Neural Networks, and for the problem in Bioinformatics, I optimized a Feature Extraction step.

**I'm still thrilled by how cool the problems I worked on were!!!** AZ really did a great job conducting the hackathon. They have shown how cool the projects they're working on actually are!

Closing remarks
------
The applications of Machine Learning I explored at AZ were super interesting! The discussions I had with my mentor were always insightful. I learnt something new in every meeting. I hope to apply what I learnt in this internship everywhere else I go (or maybe again at AstraZeneca, someday).

Again, I'm deeply grateful, especially to my mentor, for being patient enough to teach me so many concepts I wasn't aware of.

I wish everyone at AstraZeneca well, and I hope they find a vaccine for Coronavirus and save humanity! 

Thank You, AstraZeneca! :D
