What was this about?
------
There were 3 problems put forward by AstraZeneca, and as a 3-member team, my friends and I worked on all of them and presented our solutions to the business leads at AstraZeneca.

The problem I worked on
------
I worked on the Expedia Hotel Recommender challenge in this hackathon. Based on each user's browsing history and clicking patterns on [The Expedia website](https://www.expedia.co.in/), I had to recommend hotels. [Here](https://github.com/srinathvrao/Kaggle/tree/master/Expedia%20Hotel%20Recommender%20Challege) are the notebooks I worked on, for the challenge.

What was the outcome at the hackathon?
------
Out of the about 20 teams that contested, we emerged victorious in the hackathon! I connected with the employees at AZ Chennai, through this hackathon. I hope to do a summer internship @ AZ.

Update:
------
I got the internship! xD Hope I do well!
