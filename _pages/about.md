I'm Srinath, an Information Technology undergrad student (2017-2021) from SSN College of Engineering (Anna University).

I build Android apps for myself and for others.
I solve [the rubik's cube](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2015SRIN10) when bored.
I help out The [Theatre Club of my college](https://www.instagram.com/ssnlightsoutplease) as a part of the crew, frequently.

Currently seeking an Image Processing and Machine Learning Internship.
