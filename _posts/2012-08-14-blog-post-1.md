What's this about?
======
Started with the [WhoIsInIt](https://github.com/srinathvrao/WhoIsInIt) Android app. Now I've implemented OpenFace successfully. I'm trying out other models, and learning more about Face Recognition, and What constitutes a face right now. 

This is also part of my college-funded student-proposed project, titled FAM (Facial Attendance Manager).

What's the aim of this project?
------
To get results as good as, if not, better than Google's FaceNet paper.

What did I get so far?
------
1. A 92% accuracy on the LFW Benchmark.
1. Inspiration to take up Image Processing, and Computer Vision, to make this better.
