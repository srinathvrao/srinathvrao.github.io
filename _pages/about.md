I'm Srinath, an Information Technology undergrad student from SSN College of Engineering (Anna University, 2017-2021).

I build Android apps for myself and for others.
I solve [the rubik's cube](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2015SRIN10) when bored.
I help out The [Theatre Club of my college](https://www.instagram.com/ssnlightsoutplease) as a part of the crew, frequently.

I'm Currently on a sabbatical. xD
I'm doing some Computer Vision research with Dr. Umarani Jayaraman at IIIT DM, Kancheepuram. 

I'm also interested in Computer Vision without Machine Learning, and Graphics. 
I'm looking to work on projects in these in the future. (ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง
