This app was my first big project in Android Studio, that actually worked just the way I wanted it to.

Once I got this working, I wanted to make it more accurate, and faster. This and my college-funded Facial Recognition-based project, is how I got into facial recognition. I'm executing, and training models to replicate what Google's FaceNet paper did.

Now, back to the app. Clarifai had very little to zero documentation on how to use their APIs. This was the toughest part of the project. A ton of googling, and StackOverflow helped find the correct snippet of code that helped us talk with Clarifai servers. This app is also connected to a Firebase Real-Time Database, to help manage attendance easily.

You can find this project [here!](https://github.com/srinathvrao/WhoIsInIt). Please do star it, and watch for future updates! :D
