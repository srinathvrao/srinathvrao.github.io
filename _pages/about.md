I make Android apps, and toast bread when bored.
I solve [the rubik's cube](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2015SRIN10) when I get frustrated.
I do [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/srinath2309) for fun.

I love all things to do with Face Detection and Recognition, and Object Detection.
