I'm Srinath, an Information Technology undergrad student from SSN College of Engineering (Anna University, 2017-2021).

I'm Currently on a sabbatical from work. I was a Computer Vision Research Intern for a year, and I've coauthored a paper, which is under review right now. I was also a Data Science Intern at AstraZeneca, where I worked on projects in Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics.

I have some experience working on Images without using Machine Learning.

Lately, I've come to like space technology. I would love it if you could tell me some simple projects I can work on, in Space Tech. Do email me, or send me a message on LinkedIn! :D
