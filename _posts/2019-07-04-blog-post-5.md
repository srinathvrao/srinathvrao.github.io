My first research internship!
------
I started this in the summer after my Sophomore year, following my interest in Computer Vision from my [Facial Attendance Manager](https://srinathvrao.github.io/posts/2018/12/FrFr/) Project.

I gave a helping hand as a research assistant for a PhD student, and worked on different problems they wanted me to explore. I can't really disclose the projects I worked on publicly, because they're experiments on private datasets, and we received written permission to work on them. So, I'm just going to say what I learnt from this internship.

What I learnt
------
- Computer Vision is not just about using Deep Learning to do X. There is a lot of work to be done on images, before you even feed it into an end-to-end CNN. 
- I learnt the basics of famous frameworks ("framous", as I like to call it) like OpenCV, DLib, Scikit-Learn, Keras, Tensorflow, and PyTorch.
