Web dev for the Model UN!
------
For the first time, I've built a dynamic website, and hosted it on a DigitalOcean droplet!

I had built a website for SSN MUN in 2018, but it was a static website, to present information to participants of the MUN.

I'll be taking down the resources for this website, but the project will be up on my [github](https://github.com/srinathvrao/ssnmun19).

What this website had
------
I built a First-Come-First-Serve based registration system. I was extremely skeptical about the performance of the website, because it was hosted on a cheap droplet on DigitalOcean.

Thankfully, it still ended performing brilliantly well! I saw about 100 concurrent users- And it didn't crash!

I used Python Flask, and MongoDb for my database. I had all of them running on the same droplet, which was the main reason for my apprehensiveness.

Thank you for making it a success!

Thanks for participating in the Model UN, and making it a success!

Also, wow! DigitalOcean really is cheap! AWS has some serious competition now!
