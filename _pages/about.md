Hi there!

I hope you're doing fine. Please do wear a mask and take precautions until we get through this Pandemic- and take care of yourself and your loved ones!

I'm Srinath, an Information Technology undergrad student from SSN College of Engineering (Anna University, 2017-2021).

I was a Computer Vision Research Intern for a year, and I've coauthored a paper, which got accepted to [IEEE CICT 2020](http://www.cict2020.iiitdm.ac.in/). I was also a Data Science Intern at AstraZeneca, where I worked on projects in Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics.

Apart from the internship at AstraZeneca, and the paper I co-wrote, I couldn't work on much else this year. Both of them were equally exhausting. But I'm back now! Time to build more cool stuff! 

I occasionally put some fun stuff [up here](https://srinathvrao.github.io/year-archive/).

I've recently started working on applications involving Quaternion Rotations, and Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping ("SLAM") algorithms. I hope to work on Lunar and/or Martian Vehicles that use SLAM algorithms sometime in the future! I'd love to use my knowledge of Computer Vision for this.
