What was the aim of this project?
------
To make a fully functioning product capable of tracking attendance, and hopefully sell it to interested companies and/or colleges.

What was the outcome?
------
My friends and I built a system to track attendance using RaspberryPis, Cameras, and Motion Sensors. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/srinathvrao/FaceRecog).

This was fully funded by SSN College of Engineering. We demoed it to the innovation cell of the college. We also demoed the project on "Innovation Day," to the Turing Award winner, Dr. Raj Reddy.

This got me interested in the practical aspects of Computer Vision, and how it can be used to augment our lives!
