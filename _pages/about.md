Hi!
I'm Srinath- a Master's student studying Computer Science at Arizona State University, in Tempe, AZ.

I worked as a Systems Engineer Intern at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) in San Diego, where I worked with the OS Imaging Team- in building custom images of Operating Systems and Text Processing pipelines using Machine Learning. I was also a Machine Learning Intern at [AstraZeneca](https://www.linkedin.com/company/astrazeneca/), in the Predictive Modelling department, where I worked on applying ML algorithms to Drug discovery. I was also a Computer Vision Research intern at IIITD&M Kancheepuram, India, where I co-wrote 2 papers on face recognition in dark environments, and facial expression and gender classification.

I build some fun stuff that I occasionally put [here](https://srinathvrao.github.io/year-archive/).

I also like solving Rubik's cubes and picking up new and obscure skills.
