Hi!
I'm Srinath- a Systems Software Engineer, working at ServiceNow, Kirkland, WA, since July '23.

I was a Master's Student in CS @ Arizona State University.

I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at [ServiceNow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/servicenow/) in San Diego, where I worked on distributing Operating Systems and Text Processing pipelines. I was also a Machine Learning Intern at [AstraZeneca](https://www.linkedin.com/company/astrazeneca/), where I applied ML algorithms to Drug discovery. I was a Computer Vision Research intern at IIITD&M Kancheepuram, India, where I co-wrote 2 papers on face recognition in dark environments; and gender and facial expression classification.

I also like solving Rubik's cubes and picking up new and obscure skills. Recently, I've been exploring rock climbing.
