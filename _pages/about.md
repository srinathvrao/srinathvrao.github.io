Hi there!

I hope you're doing fine. Please do take care of yourself and your loved ones! We can get through this Pandemic!

I'm Srinath, a Master's student, studying Computer Science student at Arizona State Univeristy, Tempe (2021-23).

I was a Data Science Intern at [AstraZeneca](https://www.linkedin.com/company/astrazeneca/). I interned in the Predictive Modelling department of AstraZeneca, where I worked on applying Machine Learning algorithms to Drug discovery. I was also a Computer Vision Research intern, and I co-wrote a paper on face recognition in dark environments that I presented at [IEEE CICT 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9312106)!!

I build some fun stuff that I occasionally put [here](https://srinathvrao.github.io/year-archive/).

I also like solving Rubik's cubes and picking up new and obscure skills.
