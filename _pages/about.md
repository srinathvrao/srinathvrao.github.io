Hi there!
I'm Srinath, a Master's student, studying Computer Science at Arizona State Univeristy, Tempe (2021-23).

I'm currently seeking Data Science, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Research internships for the Summer of 2022. You can email me at svenkoba@asu.edu. You can also find my resume [here](https://srinathvrao.github.io/resume/). Looking forward to getting in touch!

I was a Machine Learning Intern at [AstraZeneca](https://www.linkedin.com/company/astrazeneca/). I interned in the Predictive Modelling department of AstraZeneca, where I worked on applying Machine Learning algorithms to Drug discovery. I was also a Computer Vision Research intern at IIITD&M Kancheepuram, India, where I co-wrote papers on face recognition in dark environments, and facial expression and gender classification.

I build some fun stuff that I occasionally put [here](https://srinathvrao.github.io/year-archive/).

I also like solving Rubik's cubes and picking up new and obscure skills.


I hope you're doing fine. Please do take care of yourself and your loved ones! We can get through this Pandemic!
